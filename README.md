# Time Tracking App

Time Tracking App is a very simple time tracking app for small businesses.
It utilises Gemini AI to interpret the user's voice or text input and log the time entries.

It interpretes the time entries as a JSON, and the entries are exported to a payroll to Salaxy utilising Salaxy API. Export is initiated by the user.


## 🌟 Features

    - Time tracking for projects and tasks
    - Voice or text input to log the time entries
    - JSON generation from inputted time entries
    - Time entries export to Salaxy via Salaxy API. Payroll created and entries added as payslip entries to an employee. A new payroll is created daily, not for every time entry.
